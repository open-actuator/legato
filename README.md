**Legato** is an open-source, unified actuator SDK designed for robotic applications. Inspired by the musical term meaning "smoothly connected", Legato provides a seamless interface for controlling actuators from different manufacturers through a consistent and easy-to-use API.

## Key Features 🚀

- Unified API for various actuator brands (e.g., MyActuator, RobStride, CubeMotors)
- Flexible support for communication protocols (initially CAN, with planned support for RS485 and others)
- Designed for extensibility—easily add new actuators
- Written in modern C++ with Python bindings available

## Supported Actuators (initial):

- [MyActuator RMD X-series](https://www.myactuator.com/rmd-x-planetarymotor)
- [RobStride](https://robstride.com/)
- [CubeMotors AK series](https://store.cubemars.com/collections/ak-series-robotic-actuation-module)
